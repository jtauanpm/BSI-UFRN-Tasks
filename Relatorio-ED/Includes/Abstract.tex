\noindent  This work aims to present a report on the Insertion-Sort, Merge-Sort and Quick-sort algorithms, which are used to solve sorting problems in a linear dataset that can be sorted. The algorithms will be analyzed here in the form of graphs that represent the execution time of their cases as a function of the size of the input, together with an analytical analysis on each algorithm and performance analysis in relation to the cost of time and memory, in addition, it will be A comparison was made between them, in order to better understand their particularities and more performative cases.

\noindent\textit{Keywords}: Algorithm, Complexity, Sorting, Data Structure.
